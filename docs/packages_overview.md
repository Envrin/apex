# Packages, Upgrades, and Components

Apex has a fairly modular design consisting of packages and components, virtually automated version control, and repositories for package and upgrade storage / retrieval.  This document 
outlines all aspects.


### Packages

apex has a standardized modular design, which not only allows you to instantly install / remove packages from any system, but all packages fit together and interact with each 
other perfectly.  Plus you can also easily develop your own packages, and if desired upload them to a public repository, or to a 
private repository that you control, allowing you to easily distribute and maintain your commercial code to your clients.  For full information on how to create, develop, and publish 
packages, see the below link.

### Components 

Although you do have virtually complete flexibility to develop whatever you'd like, there are standardized components available within Apex that 
help provide more efficient, quality, and standardized development.  For example, within a couple short minutes you can quickly develop a quality, stylish 
data table displaying any information you'd like in any format, with full AJAX functionality for pagination, search, sort, and row deletion.  The components all use abstract classes for 
standardization, and are very easy to develop and implement.

### Upgrades

For all intents, automated version control is also included with Apex.  You can create upgrade points, and upon doing so, Apex will automatically 
keep track of all modifications to the package.  When ready, it's one command to package and upload the upgrade, and it becomes instantly available to all 
systems with that package installed on their system.  For full information on how to create and publish upgrades, please
