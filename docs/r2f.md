# Questions

1. Package time limits -- what happens upon expiry?  They stop earning commissions, and are forced to renew / upgrade, even if they're not at the 5x lmit yet?
2. Can members upgrade, and only pay the difference?  For example, S1 to s2 = $1500, or do they pay full price of S2 of $2499?
3. Specs mention if members want to purchase larger package (eg. 50,000 or 200,000), but largest package is S3 at $19,999.  Calrification, please?
4. How are pre-launch packages assigned to members?  Manually by admin, invite code, registration link in e-mail, invite from another member, or?
5. Need explanation of how BV points are accumulated.  Specs only say 8%, 9%, 10% for the weaker legs, but don't mention how many levels deep, time frequency, etc.
6. Confirm, you want users to define BTC withdrawal addresses, and have commissions sent to them?  Please note, you will now have full web wallet functionality, so can just deposit BTC into their internal wallet account, which users can then use as their wallet and withdraw from as they desire.  Keeping funds in their R2F wallet accounts may be beneficial for upsells, if / when you launch an exchange, etc., as it inclines them to spend the funds with you.  Please confirm if you still want members to define BTC withdrawal addresses then have you send commissions to them, or just have the BTC dropped into their R2F web wallet.
7.) How did you want KYC/AML handled?  Did you want to use NetVerify API?  Or just have members upload documents via member's area, which are manually approved by administration?
8. What happens to signups from main corporate site (domain.com, not member site)?  Go under company account, get disbursed amongst membership?  If disbursed, amongst all members, or only specific groups, or?
9. Any need to support fiat payments (eg. buy / sell coin functionality)?  If yes, do you know what fiat payment processors you will offer?
10. Any marketing tools you need in the member's area for users?  Integration with Facebook / Twitter / Instagram accounts, Mailchimp integration, landing page creation, or whatever?

Few other points regarding your specs:

- Currently, software gets BTC exchange rate from the popular coinmarketcap.com site, as it has an excellent API, and is the defacto industry leader for crypto-currency exchange rates.  Let me know if you want that changed though.

- Will hit the system instantly with no delay, and no third party services.  Users will have a web wallet within the system, so upon purchasing a package, system will try to deduct from existing balance and if not available, display payment page with unique payment address and QR code and expiration time in minutes / seconds as defind by admin.

- Yes, each user also has a wallet password that is separate from their account password.  After registering, upon first logging into the member's area, they will be prompted to define a wallet password.  This generates a BIP32 key-pair for them, encrypted via AES256 using their wallet password.  Wallet passwords are not stored anywhere in the system, and are required to decrypt that BIP32 key in order to send funds, providing a great deal of security.


- No problem, and for example, visit the Settings->Notifications menu of the demo admin panel at https://demo.envrin.com/admin/.  At the bottom of the page, select "User Notifications", and submit to create a notification.  On the next page you will see where you specify the condition that must be met for e-mails to go out.  This will be the same, just more options for commissions, downline placements, etc.

- SMS messages Go out via https://nexmo.com/ so you'll need an account with them.  They're a global leader in SMS delivery, plus Apex already integrates with them.

- Providing staff access to admin panel is no problem, as upon creating administrators you can (or will be able to, I guess) check exactly which menus they have access to.  Upon logging in, they will only see those menus, and all others will be hidden.

- Full support ticketing system is in place, although still need FAQ / Knowledgebase functionality, and will do.  If desired, system also allows handling of tickets via e-mail, so incoming e-mails to support@domain.com get piped into the support ticketing system, if the sender e-mail exists as a user, new ticket is opened under their account, otherwise ticket goes to a public pool for processing.  Then upon replying to a ticket via e-mail, it naturally gets added as a reply in the support ticket system under the appropriate ticket.
