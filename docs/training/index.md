# Training Guide

This guide serves to take you through all aspects of developing quality online software operations with Apex, as quickly and efficiently as possible.  This guide will be clean, 
concise, and to the point, yet will provide all information you need to fully develop with Apex.  Instead of just doing 
a simple "Hello World" app, we will do something more real world, and instead will develop an online lending application.
