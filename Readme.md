# apex

Powerful PHP framework that allows for the efficient, streamlined development of high quality, secure, professional online operations.

This is still pre-release, and please do not use it for anything except code snippets if you'd like.  For now, just monitor progress at http://apex.envrin.com/ for updates, and first release should be ready by October 15th, 2018 at the latest.

Loads of documentation is now available starting at the [/docs/index.md](docs/index.md) file.

If interested in the project, or would like to contribute, pease e-mail apex@envrin.com.  I went blind a couple years ago, so could really use a designer who has a working set of eyes.
